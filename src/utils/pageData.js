    longIntro: `
        <p>&emsp;&emsp; Hi there, I'm Debanjan Ganguly, an analytics professional who loves connecting the dots and uncovering hidden stories within data. Currently, I'm working as a business analyst at Navi.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;I began my journey through childhood with a love of video games. This passion for technology led me to computer science and a career in data analytics, specifically in finance. Driven by a desire to constantly learn and evolve, and embrace innovative new technologies, I seek to create innovations that make a real impact on our planet and our daily lives.</p>
        <p>&emsp;&emsp;My long-term dream? Early retirement and a peaceful farm life, but for now, I enjoy wandering mountain trails or caring for stray animals. Always up for a chat about data, tech, or adventure!</p>
